AWSAsyncTest
============

Testing of AWS .NET SDK with Async

Contains 2 different solutions with console applications: one use old version of AWS SDK (1.5) and second use new version (2.0.0.1) with async support.

Note: as of today (30/07/2013) latest SDK 2.0.0.1 fails to execute PutObject requests. Corresponding issue opened at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/26
